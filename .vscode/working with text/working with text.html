    <h1>Working with Text</h1>

    <p>The body is the element that wraps what shows on the HTML page. As I write this I am using p tag enclosed in arrows to show paragraphs.</p>

    <p> We seperate paragraphs using p tag enclosed in arrows.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The space between this paragraphs and the one above is created using a line break tag. The tag is br contained in arrows. </p>
    
    <p> The header is an H# tag. The H stands for the header and the number following the H is the size of the Header with 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest. The H and the sizing are contained within arrows.
        <br>
        <p> The <strong> Strong </strong>element makes the text <strong>BOLD</strong>.</p>
        <p> The <em> EMPHASIS</em> tag makes the text <em>EMPHASIZE</em> the word.</p>
        <p> These tags can be nested within an element and we show this using indentation.</p>
        <p> We can comment non showing lines in HTML with !---- enclosed in arrows. The comment cannot be seen on this page but in the code it will show.</p>
        <!--commenting appears in the HTML code but not in the GUI-->
