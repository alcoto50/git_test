    <h1> Links and Images</h1>

    <p>Links connect websites to one another. When creating a link we have to start with an anchor element an opening and closing (A) surrounding the link. The anchor element cannot work by itself, it needs a destination. Below is an example of a anchored website. The href="" is how you assign the link. </p><!--A is for anchor-->
<div>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
</div>
<p> We can have the link open in a new tab using the <bold> TARGET</bold> attribute. While href specifies the destination <bold>Target</bold> specifies where the link should be opened. Can also use <bold> _BLANK
to open the link.
</bold>
<p> the noopener value of the rail attribute ensures that a link opened in a new window cannot interact or access the origional page.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p> There are two kinds of links, <em> Absolute</em>, and <em> Relative </em>. </p>
    <p> 1.Absolute links to other websites on the internet. The syntax scheme for an absolute link is:<em> //domain/path</em>. The absolute domain will always have the scheme and domain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Relative links to other pages within our own website. They do not include domain names since it is directed towards the same page. The only include the file path to the other page.</p>
