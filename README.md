# My Full Stack Developer journey here @ TOP

Hello Odin! My name is Al and I am here to learn eveything that I can about becoming a full stack developer. I figured that I would take this opportunity to kind of create this read me in order to track my learning progress. You know what they say,"practice makes perfect" and if I practice and study and develope "GRIT" I will eventually learn and become good enough to interview, and "Yes!" we talk'n bout "PRACTICE!" So lets get into this and as I go I will create files that I can look at and study in this READ ME.

I am starting with the HTML Boiler Plate and will work my way through TOP while documenting my progress and adding to this read me as I go with personal notes that will help improve my overall understand of Full stack Devo and also help me to memorize.

6/14 8am-10am: worked on "Elements & Tags" section and the "BoilerPlate lesson" created some list items as well as headers and paragraphs in my index.html file.

They are listed in my vs code files under elements&tags.html and boiler plates.html. They are just screens that show the process with html comments !--. that explain what each line of code is doing. I feel comfortable enough to move on to links and images. this will involve the anchor element.

Side notes: shortcuts that I have learned is VS editor include:<br>
command arrow left/right: to move cursor to beginning or end of last line.<br> command arrow up/dowm: to move cursor to beginning or end of document.
<br> command arrow up L: selects all occurrances of current selection.
<br> command F2: select all occurances of selected word.

6/14 11am-1pm: Just finished the "Working with text" portion of HTML. I am starting to recognize patters and names. Certian Tags can be enclosed in Elements.
This is called nesting and to show a element that contains a nested Tag, we usually indent as a way of keeping the code uniform and organized.
