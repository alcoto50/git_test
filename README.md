# My Full Stack Developer journey here @ TOP

Hello Odin! My name is Al and I am here to learn eveything that I can about becoming a full stack developer. I figured that I would take this opportunity to kind of create this read me in order to track my learning progress. You know what they say, practice makes perfect and if I practice and study and develope "GRIT" I will eventually learn and become good. Yes we talk'n bout "PRACTICE!" So lets get into this and as I go I will create files that I can look at and study.

I am starting with the HTML Boiler Plate and will work my way through TOP while documenting my progress and adding to this read me as I go personal notes that will help improve my overall understand of Full stack Devo.
