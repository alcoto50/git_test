# My Full Stack Developer journey here @ TOP

Hello Odin! My name is Al and I am here to learn eveything that I can about becoming a full stack developer. I figured that I would take this opportunity to kind of create this read me in order to track my learning progress. You know what they say,"practice makes perfect" and if I practice and study and develope "GRIT" I will eventually learn and become good enough to interview, and "Yes!" we talk'n bout "PRACTICE!" So lets get into this and as I go I will create files that I can look at and study in my git-test repo.

I am starting with the HTML Boiler Plate and will work my way through TOP while documenting my progress and adding to this read me as I go with personal notes that will help improve my overall understand of Full stack Devo and also help me to memorize.

6/14 8am-10am: worked on "Elements & Tags" section and the "BoilerPlate lesson" created some list items as well as headers and paragraphs in my TOP INTRO.html file(consider it my index just renamed).

They are listed in my vs code files under elements&tags.html and boiler plates.html. They are just screens that show the process with html comments !--. that explain what each line of code is doing. I feel comfortable enough to move on to links and images. this will involve the anchor element.

Side notes: shortcuts that I have learned is VS editor include:<br>
command arrow left/right: to move cursor to beginning or end of last line.<br> command arrow up/dowm: to move cursor to beginning or end of document.
<br> command arrow up L: selects all occurrances of current selection.
<br> command F2: select all occurances of selected word.

6/14 11am-1pm: Just finished the "Working with text" portion of HTML. I am starting to recognize patters and names. Certian Tags can be enclosed in Elements.
This is called nesting and to show a element that contains a nested Tag, we usually indent as a way of keeping the code uniform and organized.

6/14 3pm-5pm: Just finishing up links and images and moving ahead to commit messeges and then start I guess my first project. Gonna shut dowwn the learning for toaday and kind of just go over the first part of this HTML lesson I guess and do the project for this section.

6/15 10am-12pm: Just finished adding and commiting html file as well as a links&images html file to my index. Feel pretty confident about my html ability and working on the commit messages part but feel really confident about my progress.Going to take a lunch before I get into the next portion which will involve me making a website with HTML. I kind of already did it though this whole documentation process so will see before creating a new project.

6/15 6pm-11pm: Just finished the hgtml challenge at the end of the HTML section and feel pretty good. I can write HTML and pretty much know the basics. Moving on to CSS starting tomorrow.

(side note: It's kind of crucial to get the html/css/javascript foundations soon so that I do not loose anything from my coding course and that I can still be viable in the workforce. Alot of times people take these bootcamps then forget everything not long after getting out. I refuse to let that happens!)

6/16 5:30-?: Morning! Just waking up and making some coffee and going through all the other morning rituals. Today I am starting on CSS so kind of sharpening my typing skills before I dive in. So lets go!!!!

6/16 5:50am-9am: Still working on my html file regarding css. This is really getting tedious but learning about CSS with all reading c&p and making key words <strong>. Also trying to use other html elements but hasn't called for much listing.

6/17 8am-Noon: Up and before I wanted to start this CSS portion wanted to have an overview to better understand the syntax and other importont rules. So have a basic understanding of the css set Selector and a property/value pair. The
