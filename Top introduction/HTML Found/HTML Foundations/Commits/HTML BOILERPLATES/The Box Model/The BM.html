    <h3><strong> Introduction</strong></h3> 
    
  
    <p>Now that you understand the basic syntax of HTML and CSS, we’re going to get serious. The most important skills you need
    to master with CSS are positioning and layout. Changing fonts and colors is a crucial skill, but being able to put
    things exactly where you want them on a webpage is even more crucial. After all, how many webpages can you find where
    absolutely every element is just stacked one on top of another?
    </p>

<p> Learning to position elements on a webpage is not that difficult once you understand just a few key concepts.
Unfortunately, many learners race through learning HTML and CSS to get to JavaScript and end up missing these
fundamental concepts. This leads to frustration and pain (and funny gifs) because all the JavaScript skills in the world
are meaningless if you can’t stick your elements on the page where you need them to be. So with that in mind, let’s get
started.</p>

<h3><strong> Lesson Overview </strong></h3>
<p>This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.
</p>
<li> You’ll learn all about the box model. </li>
<li>You’ll learn how to make sure elements are just the right size with <strong> margin </strong>,<strong>padding</strong>, and <strong>borders</strong>. </li>

<h3><strong> The box Model </strong></h3>
<p>The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful in CSS is the box model. It isn’t complicated,
but skipping over it now would cause you much frustration down the line.</p>
<p>Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one
another. You can get a rough idea of how this works by applying an outline to every element on the page like this:</p>
<div>
    <p> * { </p>
        <p> outline: 2px solid red; </p>
        <p> } </p>

        <p>You can use the browser’s inspector to add the CSS above to this web page if you want, by clicking the + button in the
        top right of the “Styles” panel within the “Elements” tab. Boxes in boxes! </p>

        <p>OK, so there might be some circles in the above image… but when it comes to layout, they fit together like rectangular
        boxes and not circles. In the end, laying out a webpage and positioning all its elements is deciding how you are going
        to nest and stack these boxes.
        </p>
        <li><strong>padding:</strong> increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.</li>
        <li><strong>border</strong> adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.</li>
        <li><strong>margin</strong> increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.</li>
        <p> Be sure to study the diagrams carefully.</p>
