    <h1> Commit messages and their Importance</h1>
    <p>Developing good commit messeges habits will make is very important. They allow other developers working on the same project to know what was happening or what you did.</p>
<p>A couple of reasons that make git commit messeging so important are as followed:</p>
    <li>When you are applying for jobs, employers will look through your projects on GitHub and they will look through your
    commit history. Having good commits as a novice developer will help you stand out</li>

    <li>Having a good commit message history will allow you (or other developers working on your code) to quickly see what
    changes were made and why. This is useful if a bug is found in the code that needs to be fixed!</li>
    <li>Having a good commit message history will also be helpful if you come back to a project you were working on after
    stepping away from it for a while. You likely won’t remember your thought process and changes made when initially
    writing out the code.
    </li>

    <h3> Bad vs good commits</h3>
    <p>When it comes to writing commits, it is crucial to know how to write them effectively. Here’s an example of a bad commit
    message:</p>
    <div><strong>Fix a bug</strong>
    </div>
    <p>Even though it describes what you did, the message is too vague, which leaves the other developers on your team
    confused. A good commit message will explain the why behind your changes. In other words, a commit message describes
    what problem your changes solve and how it solves them.</p>
    <p>Even though it describes what you did, the message is too vague, which leaves the other developers on your team
    confused. A good commit message will explain the why behind your changes. In other words, a commit message describes
    what problem your changes solve and how it solves them.</p>
    <p>Effective commits consist of two seperate parts: a <strong>subject</strong> and a <strong>body</strong>.</p>

    <h3> Subject </h3>
    <p>A brief summary of the change you made to the project.</p>

    <p> <strong>This is the change I made to the codebase</strong>
    </p>
    <p><em>GitHub has a 72-character limit, so we recommend keeping your commits’ subjects within this amount.</em></p>

    <h3> Body</h3>
    <p>a concise yet clear description of what was done.</p>

    <p><strong>Describe the problem your commit solves and how.</strong></p>

    <p>Describe the problem your commit solves and how.</p>

    <p>Now that we learned the secret to creating a good commit message, let’s try and fix the commit message from earlier:</p>

    <li><strong>Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo</strong></li>
    
    <li><strong>Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information.
        </strong></li>
        <br>

        <p>Ahh, that’s better! Now, developers can gain a better understanding of this commit message because it does the
        following:
        </p>
        <li>Contains a body that provides a concise yet clear description of why the commit needed to be made (e.g., “Screen readers
        won’t read the images to users with disabilities without this information.”).
        </li>
        <li>Separates the subject from the body with a new/blank line. This is a best practice we highly recommend following. It
        makes commit messages easier for other developers to read.</li>
        <h3>How to commit with a subject and body in the message</h3>
        <p>Up until now, you’ve been told to commit with git commit -m <message>. To make a commit with subject and body in
            message, the simplest way is to type git commit without the -m flag and message argument.</p>
            <p>Doing so will open a new Visual Studio Code tab if you had set Visual Studio Code as the Git editor. You can remove any
            comments and enter your multi-line messages. When you save and close the tab, your commit will be created.</p>
            <h3>When to commit</h3>
            <p>A good way to view a commit is like a “snapshot” of your code at the moment that it was made. That version of your code
            up to that point will be saved for you to revert back to or look back at.</p>
            <p>When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This
            will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.</p>
            <p>n other words, make a commit if you get a piece of code you are working on to function like you want it to, fix a typo,
            or fix a bug. As you gain experience, you will develop a better feel for what should be committed!</p>
            <p>There will come a time when you are working on a project and you FINALLY get something just right (this would be a good
            time to commit), and then maybe 30 seconds to a few days later it breaks. You have no idea what you changed, everything
            looks to be the same and you don’t remember editing that line, but alas, it isn’t working how you want it anymore. You’d
            be able to go back through your commit history and either revert your code back to the last commit you made when you
            first got that part working or go back and see what your code looked like at that point in time.
