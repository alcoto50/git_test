        <h2>I am a full stack developer practicing to become really good at coding!</h2>

            <p>In order to get good you have to practice and develope grit.

        
            
            I am getting better but realize that it takes time and patience in order to be a good developer! I am creating this repository as I go to demonstrate what I have learned and what I am learning in order to obtain my dream job of being a full stack web devoloper!</p>
            
            <p> As I go I am documenting this work using GitHub to commit work and keep stay focused on the projects. I honestly have no idea where this is going but if I keep hacking away @ this personal project I will eventually get the whole full stack objective. </p>
            <p> I am currently on the first part of TOP which is mostly HTML so just kind of navigating my way and making a road map as I go for better retention!</p>
