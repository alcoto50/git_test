    <H1>Intro to CSS</H1>

    <h3><stong>Introduction</stong></h3>
    <p>In the previous lesson, you learned how to write the HTML that determines how a web page is structured. The next step is
    to make that structure look good with some style, which is exactly what CSS is for. In the next few lessons, we’re going
    to focus on what we believe are some foundational CSS concepts, things that everyone should know from the beginning —
    whether they are just starting out or need a refresher.</p>

    <h3><strong>Lesson Overview</strong></h3>
    <p>This section contains a general overview of topics that youo will learn in this lesson</p>

    <li> Add styles with CSS.</li>
    <li> Understand how to use the class and ID attributes.</li>
    <li> Add styles to specific elements using the correct selectors.</li>

    <h3><strong>Basic Syntax</strong></h3>
    <p>At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selector (more on this in a bit)
    and a semicolon-separated list of declarations, with each of those declarations being made up of a property–value pair.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>A div element is one of the basic HTML elements. It is an empty container. In general, it is best to use other tags such as (h1) or (p) for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you’ll find that there are many cases wherethe thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain (div)s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.</p>

<h3><strong>Selectors</strong></h3>
<p>Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they’re what is actually being “selected” for each rule.
The following subsections don’t cover every selector available, but they’re by far the most common and the ones you
should get comfortable using first.</p>

<h3>Universal Selector</h3>
<p>The universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole document), hence the name “universal”, and
the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the color: purple; style applied
to it.</p>
<div>
  <p>  * {
  <p>  color: purple;</p>
  <p>  }</p>
</div>

<h3>Type selector</h3>
  <p>A type selector or (<strong> element selector </strong>) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the
name of the element:</p>
<!--Instead of using element tags <> I am using ()-->
    <div>
    <p><em>(!--index.html --)</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>(div)</strong> Hello, World! <strong>(/div)</strong></p>

    <p><strong>(div)</strong> Hello, again! <strong>(/div)</strong></p>

    <p> (p)Hi..(/p)</p>

    <p><strong>(div)</strong>Okay, bye.<strong>(/div)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>Here, all three (<strong>div elements would be selected, while the (p) element wouldn't be.</strong></p><br>

    <h3>Class Selector</h3>

    <p>Class selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element.
    Here’s how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:</p>
    <div>
        <p> <strong><em>(!-- index.html --)</em></strong></p> <!--using () instead of <>-->
     </div>
     <div>   
        <p>(div class="<strong>alert-text</strong>") Please agree to our terms of service.)</p>
        <!--using () instead of <>-->
        <p><em>/* styles.css*/</em></p>
    
        <p> <strong>.alert-text</strong> { </p>
            <p> color: red;</p>
        <p> } </p>
    </div>

        <p>Note the syntax for class selectors:<bold> a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute.</bold>
        Classes aren’t required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you
        want.
        </p>
        <p>Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated
        list, such as class="alert-text severe-alert". Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should
        never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>ID selectors</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>ID selectors</strong> are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given <strong>ID,</strong> which is another attribute you
        place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have <strong>one ID</strong>. It
        cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:</p>
    <div> 
        <p><strong><em>(!--  index.html --)</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong> (div id ="title")</strong> My Awesome 90's page(/div)</p>
        </div>
        <p>/*styles.css*/</p>
        <p><strong>#title</strong> {</p>
            <p>background-color: red;</p>
            <p> } </p>
    </div>
<p>For IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A
common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don’t necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice.
While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having
links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs <strong>sparingly</strong> (if at all).</p>

<h3><strong>The Grouping Selector</strong></h3>
<p>What if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?</p>
    <div> 
    <p> .read { </p>
        <p> color: white;</p>
    <p>background-color: black;</p>
    <p> /* several unique declarations */</p>
    <p> } </p>
    <br>
    <p> .unread { </p>
        <p>color: white</p>
        <p>background-color: black;</p>
        <p> /*several unique declarations */</p>
        <p> } </p>
    </div>

    <p>Both our <strong>.read</strong> and<strong>.unread</strong> selectors share the <strong>color: white;</strong> and <strong>background-color: black;</strong>  declarations, but otherwise
    have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together
    as a <strong>comma-separated list:</strong>
    </p>

    <div>
        <p> .read </p>
        <p> .unread { </p>
            <p> color: white:</p>
            <p>background-color: black;</p>
            <p> } </p>
            
            <p>The css below will also work but your using more space.</p>
            <p> .read { </p>
                <p> /* several unique declarations */</p>
                <p> } </p>
                
            <p> .unread { </p>
                <p> /*several unique declarations */</p>
                <p> } </p>
    </div>

    <p>Both of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the
    repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the <strong>color</strong>  or<strong> background-color</strong> for both classes at once.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Chaining selectors</strong></h3>
     <p>Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let’s say we had the following HTML:</p>
     <div>
        <p><strong><em>( html.index )</em></strong></p>
        <p> (div) </p>
        <p> (div class="subsection header">Latest Posts(/div)</p>
        <p> (p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for post might go.(/p)</p>
     </div>

     <p>We have two elements with the <strong>subsection</strong> class that have some sort of unique styles, buemt what if we only want to apply a
    separate rule to the element that also has <strong>header</strong> as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors
    together in our CSS like so:
     </p>
     <div>
        <p> .subscription.header { </p>
            <p> color: red; </p>
            <p> } </p>
     </div>
     <p>What <strong>.subsection.header</strong> does is it selects any element that has both the <strong>subsection</strong> and <strong>header</strong> classes. Notice how there
    isn’t any space between the <strong>.subsection</strong> and <strong> .header </strong> class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one <em>type selector</em>.
     </p>
     <p>This can also bne used to chain a class and an <strong>ID</strong> as shown below:</p>

    <p> (div) </p>
    <p> (div class ="subsection header") latest post (/div)</p>
    <p> (p class ="subsection" id="preview") </p>
    <p><em> This is where a preview for a post might go</em></p>
    <p> (/p) </p>
    <p> (/div) </p>
    <p> You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following</p>

    <p> .subsection.header { </p>
        <p> color: red; </p>
        <p> } </p>
        <p> .subsection#preview { </p>
            <p> color: blue </p>
            <p> } </p>

            <p>In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For
            example, chaining two type selectors like div and p would give us the selector divp, which wouldn’t work since the
            selector would try to find a literal <divp> element, which doesn’t exist.
            </p>

            <h3>Descendant combinator</h3>
            <p>Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a
            relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we’re going to only
            show you the <strong><em>descendant combinator, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors</em></strong>. 
     It will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent,
            grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.</p>
            <p>So something like .ancestor .child would select an element with the class child if it has an ancestor with the class
            ancestor. Another way to think of it is that child will only be selected if it is nested inside ancestor, regardless of
            how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be
            selected based on the CSS rule provided:</p>

            <p><strong><em>! Index.html</em></strong></p>
            <p> div class="ancestor">
                <p> <em>--A--</em></p>
                <p>div class="contents"></p>
                <p><em>--B--</em></p>
            </p>
            <p>div class ="contents" <em>--C--</em> (/div) </em></p>
            <p> (/div) </p>

            <p> (div class="contents" <em>--D--</em></p>

            <p> <strong><em> Styles.css </em></strong></p>

            <p>.ancestor .content { </p>
                <p> *some declarations</p>
                <p> } </p>
                <p>In the above example, the first two elements with the contents class (B and C) would be selected, but that last element
                (D) wouldn’t be. Was your guess correct?</p>
            <h3>Properties to get started with</h3>
            <p>There are some CSS properties that you’re going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not.
            We’re going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the
            following properties will be enough to help get you started.</p>

            <p><strong>Color and Background-color</strong></p>
            <p>The color property sets an element’s text color, while background-color sets, well, the background color of an element.
            I guess we’re done here?
            </p>
            <p>Almost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual
            color name like red or the transparent keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar
            with if you’ve ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.
            </p>
            <div>
            <p> p { </p>
                <p><em>*hex example:*</em></p>
                <p> color: #1100ff;</p>
                <p> } </p>
                <p> p { </p>
                    <p><em>*rgb example: * </em></p>
                    <p> color: rgb(100, 0, 127); </p>
<p> } </p>
<p> p { </p>
    <p>/em * hsl example: * /em</p>
    <p>color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);</p>
    <p> } </p>
    </div>
    <p>Take a quick look at CSS Legal Color Values to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha
    value.
    </p>

    <h3>Typography basics and text-align</h3>

    <p><strong>font-family</strong> can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each
    font will fall into one of two categories, either a “font family name” like <strong>"Times New Roman"</strong> (we use quotes due to the
    whitespace between words) or a “generic family name” like <strong> serif </strong> (generic family names never use quotes).</p>
    <p>If a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and
    so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it’s best practice to include a list of values for this
    property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g.
    <strong>font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>font-size</strong> will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value
    should not contain any whitespace, e.g. <strong>font-size: 22px</strong> has no space between “22” and “px”.</p>
    <p><strong>font-weight</strong> affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword,
    e.g. <strong>font-weight:</strong> bold, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. <strong>font-weight: 700</strong> (the equivalent of <strong>bold</strong>). Usually, the
    numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.
    </p>
    <p><strong>text-align</strong> will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across
    in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. <strong>text-align:</strong> center.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Image height and width</strong></h3>
    <p>Images aren’t the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in
    this case.</p>
    <p>By default, an img element’s height and width values will be the same as the actual image file’s height and width. If
    you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of “auto”
    for the height property and adjust the width value:</p>
    <br>
    <p> img { </p>
        <p> height: auto; </p>
        <p> width: 500px:</p>
        <p> } </p>
            <p>For example, if an image’s original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height
            of 250px.
            </p>
            <p>These properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of
            these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the
            image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the
            page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page
            contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a <strong>height</strong> and <strong>width</strong> prevents this from happening, as space will be
            “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Adding CSS to HTML</strong></h3>
            <p>Now that we’ve learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering how to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three
            methods to do so.</p>

            <p><strong>external CSS</strong></p>
            <p>External CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and
            linking it inside of an HTML’s opening and closing
            head tags with a void link element:</p>
                
                <p> --Index.html--*</p>
                <p> head </p>
                <p> link rel="stylesheet" href=:'styles.css'</p>
                <p> /head </p>

                <p><strong><em> *--styles.css * </em></strong></em></p>
                <p> div { </p>
                    <p> color: white;</p>
                    <p>background-color: black; </p>
                    <p> } </p>

                    <p> p { </p>
                    <p> color: red; </p>
                    <p> } </p>
                    <p>First, we add a void<strong>
                    (link) </strong> element inside of the opening and closing<strong>
                    
                    (head) </strong> tags of the HTML file. The <strong>href</strong> attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you’ll
                        be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are
                        located in the same directory. The <strong> rel </strong> attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML
                        file and the linked file.
                    </p>
                    <p> Then inside of the newly created <strong>styles.css</strong> file, we have the selector (the <strong> div </strong>strong> and <strong>p</strong>, followed by a pair of opening
                    and closing curly braces, which create a “declaration block”. Finally, we place any declarations inside of the
                    declaration block. <strong>color: white;</strong> is one declaration, with <strong>color</strong> being the property and <strong>white</strong> being the value, and
                    <strong>background-color: black;</strong> is another declaration.</p>

                    <p>A note on file names: <strong>styles.css</strong> is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you
                    want as long as the file type is <strong>.css</strong>, though “style” or “styles” is most commonly used.</p>
                    <p>A couple of the pros to this method are:
                    </p>
                    <li> 1.It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner. </li>
                    <li> 2. We only need to edit the CSS in one place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar
                    styles.
                    </li>
                    <p><strong>Internal CSS</strong></p>
                    <p>Internal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely
                    separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <strong>(style)</strong>
                        tags,
                        which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <strong>(head)</strong>tags of your HTML file. Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the <strong>(head)</strong>tags,
                        we no longer need a <strong>(link)</strong>element that the external method requires.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides these differences, the syntax is exactly the same as the external method (selector, curly braces, declarations):</p>
                    <div>
                        <p> (head) </p>
                        <p> (style) </p>
                        <p> div { </p>
                            <p> color:white; </p>
                            <p> background_color: black; </p>
                            <p> } </p>
                            <br>
                            <p> p { </p>
                                <p> color: red; </p>
                                <p> } </p>
                                <p> (/styles) </p>
                                <p> (/head) </p>
                                <p> (body)
                                <p> (/body) </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This method can be useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website, but it doesn’t keep things separate
                    like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get
                    pretty big.

                    <p><strong> Inline CSS </strong></p>
                    <p>Inline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn’t as recommended:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> (body) </p>
                    <p> (div style ="color: white; background-color: black;"...(/div)<p>
                        <p> (/body) </p>

                        <p> The first thing to note is that we don’t actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to
                        the opening <strong>(div)</strong> tag itself. Next, we have the <strong>style=</strong> attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks
                            being the declarations.</p>
                            <p> If you need to add a unique style for a single element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn’t
                            exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:</p>
                            <li> It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a lot of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML
                            file to become unnecessarily bloated.</li>
                            <li> If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual
                            element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.</li>
                            <li> Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results. (While we won’t dive into it
                            here, this can actually be taken advantage of.)
                            </li>
</body>
